    "about-us.genesis.p1": "For a last few years I was working on the project 'Electronic Invoices' (for the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan). I was asked to take a closer look at the blockchain technology and analyze if it fits it in one of our projects. Even though this technology is not suitable for us but I was amazed by what I have learned. At the same time crypto-currency hype was on it’s peak and the same for other blockchain related projects. It is unbelievable how much time and effort was spent on all types of fraud.",
    "about-us.genesis.p2": "The second milestone for the continuation of this project was a meeting with a housing cooperative employee.

Certainly traditional banks will stay in place since full customer service is necessary and till the day a bigger number of blockchain communities a full-fledged bank will be required.",

    "project.bank.proposal.p3": "Blockchain banks could become fully open banks, or at least be much more transparent. Such banks can guarantee to clients that their funds will not be lost. They should become separate entities, not just an new division of any closed bank, transparency could not be achieved when only a small part of the operations will be revealed.",
    "project.bank.proposal.p4": "Bank secrecy act and transparency are conflicting and here is a big question: what information about the account activities should be available to everyone and what should be private and encrypted. However encryption does not guarantee that the data will not be eventually decoded.",
    "project.bank.proposal.p5": "A lot of questions should be answered prior to creation of such public banks. Initial 'pilot' implementations could have a number of vulnerabilities and problems but first steps in this direction must be made. Best case scenario is to implement such public banks within the central banks because of this could reduce the back pressure of commercial banks and also serve as an incentive for others to integrate with it.",

    "project.ussr-2.0.money.header": "About the money",
    "project.ussr-2.0.money.p1": "All money is a matter of belief. Few centuries ago people believed that gold is an equivalent of value, today they believe that special 'pape' is such value equivalent. And in a past decade some people who believe that 'nothing' (crypto-currencies) also have value began to appear.",
    "project.ussr-2.0.money.p2": "There are crypto-anarchists who think that crypto-currencies can become a non-government money and existence of crypto-currencies will allow society to take money issue and flow under public control. But if you want to win you have be smarter than your opponent. In modern society questions about what the money really is and how to take them under public control are not even discussed.",
    "project.ussr-2.0.money.p3": "Society does not need money itself, instead the real needs are goods and services created as a result of labor. In order for society to break free the very faith in money and its necessity should be destroyed.
